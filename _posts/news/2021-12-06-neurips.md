We won both tracks of the NeurIPS competition on [Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning](https://izmailovpavel.github.io/neurips_bdl_competition/)!
Please join our talk at the [NeurIPS 2021 competition track](https://nips.cc/virtual/2021/competition/22444) and at the [BDL workshop](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org) to learn about our solution.
