We won both tracks of the NeurIPS competition on [Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning](https://izmailovpavel.github.io/neurips_bdl_competition/)!
Please join our talks at the [NeurIPS 2021 competition track](https://nips.cc/virtual/2021/competition/22444) (Friday, Dec. 9th, 6pm GMT) and at the [BDL workshop](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org) (Tuesday, Dec. 14th, 4:40pm GMT) to learn about our solution.
