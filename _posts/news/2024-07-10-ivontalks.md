Our paper [Variational Learning is Effective for Large Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17641) is highlighted at [ICML 2024](http://icml.cc) as a spotlight.
If you are at ICML, please make sure to check it out! 
Before heading to ICML in Vienna, [Thomas MÃ¶llenhoff](http://moellenh.github.io) is giving four talks on the work:
* July 5, [ISBA 2024](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home), Ca' Foscari University in Venice,
* July 8, The [computer vision group](https://cvg.cit.tum.de) at TU Munich,
* July 10, The [data science group](https://datascience-lmu.github.io/website/) at University of Munich,
* July 18, The [efficient learning and probabilistic inference for science](https://fortuinlab.github.io) group at [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai).
