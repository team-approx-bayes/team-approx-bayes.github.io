Bayesian Deep Learning hopes to tackle neural networksâ€™ poorly-calibrated uncertainties by injecting some level of Bayesian thinking. There has been mixed success: progress is difficult as scaling Bayesian methods to such huge models is difficult! One promising direction of research is based on natural-gradient variational inference. We shall motivate and derive such algorithms, and then analyse their performance at a large scale, such as on ImageNet.
