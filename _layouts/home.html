Humans, animals, and other living beings have a natural ability to autonomously learn throughout their lives and quickly adapt to their surroundings, but computers lack such abilities.
Our goal is to bridge such gaps between the learning of living-beings and computers.
We are machine learning researchers with an expertise in areas such as approximate inference, Bayesian statistics, continuous optimization, information geometry, etc.
We work on a variety of learning problems, especially those involving supervised, continual, active, federated, online, and reinforcement learning. Please check out
<a href="../research/">research</a> and <a href="../publications">publications</a> pages for a more exhaustive overview.
<br><br>
If you are interested in joining us, see the <a href="../people">people</a> page and the news below for current opportunities.
